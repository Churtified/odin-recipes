    <h2 class="description">Description</h2>
    <p class="blurb">Nuoc cham is the quintessential Vietnamese dipping sauce. It is used in a variety of Vietnamese dishes in many applications. Every family has their own variation of this sauce, and this is my familyâ€™s recipe! Included in this recipe are instructions on how to make different variations of this sauce and substitutions for ingredients.</p>
    <h2 class="ingredients-title">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients-lists">
        <li>6 tbsp water</li>
        <li>2 tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>1.5 tbsp freshly squeezed lime or lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 tbsp fish sauce</li>
        <li>2 clove garlic minced</li>
        <li>1 bird's eye / Thai chilli finely sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="steps-title">Steps</h2>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li>Combine water and sugar in a bowl. Optional: heat 1/3 of the water, then mix in to make dissolving the sugar easier, then add the rest of the water.</li>
        <li>Add lime or lemon juice in increments until you like how it tastes. A good guide is it should taste like lemonade/limeade.</li>
        <li>Add fish sauce in small increments until you like how it tastes. It should be a little strong since it will be paired with unseasoned food.</li>
        <li>Top with garlic and chilies then serve.</li>
    </ol>
